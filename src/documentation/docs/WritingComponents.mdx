# Create you own component

## Implementing

In this example a simple component will be created, which displays some text in a specific color.
The text will be the default slot and the color a prop.

For this purpose a new folder is created, named after the component `Example`, and includes an `index.tsx`. Optional a `style.css` can be included aswell.
<br />

In the `index.tsx`-file the code for the component must be written.
This project uses jsx with the Babel plugin for Vue. Further information can be found <a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html#JSX">here</a>.


This is how the index.tsx looks like.
```
import { BaseComponent } from "@/components";

@Component({
  name: "Example",
})
class Example extends BaseComponent<ExampleProps> {
@Prop({ required: false, default: "black" }) color!: ExampleProps["color"];

render() {
    let colorClass = "";
    if(color === 'black' || color === 'white') colorClass = `text-${color}`;
    else colorClass = `text-${color}-500`;
    return (
      <div class={colorClass}>
        { this.$slots.default }
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

In this project the CSS-Framework <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="text-blue-500">TailwindCSS</a> is used.

<br />

The `ExampleProps` are not yet available. It needs to be written in the file `types/components.d.ts`
In this file a new interface needs to be created and in it all the props are described.
<br />
This is the interface for the example:

```
export interface ExampleProps {
  /**
   * color in which the text is displayed
   *
   * Possible values are: **black** | **white** **red** | **blue** | **green**
   *
   * Default value is **black**
   */
  color: "black" | "white" |"red" | "blue" | "green";
}

export class Example extends Component<ExampleProps> {}
```

The property needs its type and with the commentary we supplement the interface with helpful information like what this prop does, if there are possible and default values
<br />
It must be ensured that the component is exported.

Therefore the file `types/components.d.ts` must be extended with the new component
At the end of the file the following line needs to be added.

```
export { default as Example } from "./Example";
```

## Adding to Documentation

The component does not yet appear in the documentation.

<br />

First we must create an example file in the `documentation/example` folder.
In this file the created component is used and later on displayed in the documentation as a rendered component and the code is shown too.

The file should be called `Example.tsx` in this case.
First a few imports need to be done.

```
import Vue from "vue";
import Component from "vue-class-component";
```

and the component needs to be imported.

```
import { Example } from "fsxa-ui";
```

Next is the frame for the component.

```
@Component
export default class App extends Vue {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>

      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Inside this `div`-Element the new component must be added.
Different variants can also be displayed there.
The complete file should look like this:

```
import Vue from "vue";
import Component from "vue-class-component";

import { Example } from "fsxa-ui";

@Component
export default class App extends Vue {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Example>This is some example text in default black</Example>
        <Example color="red">This is some example text in red</Example>
        <Example color="white">This is some example text in white</Example>
        <Example color="green">This is some example text in green</Example>
        <Example color="blue">This is some example text in blue</Example>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

```

<br />

Next up a file must be created in the `documentation/docs/components` folder.

In this example it is called `Example.mdx`
<br />
To document the components the library <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx"  class="text-blue-500">MDX.js</a> is used.
It supports the regular markdown syntax with additional features.
<br />

There are some components available so that the documentation can be better visualized.
<br />

They need to be imported:
```
import Meta from "@/components/internal/Documentation/Meta";
import PropsTable from "@/components/internal/Documentation/PropsTable";
import PropsTableRow from "@/components/internal/Documentation/PropsTable/components/PropsTableRow";
import Code from "@/components/internal/Documentation/Code";
import ExampleLoader from "@/documentation/utils/ExampleLoader";
```

With the `Meta` component we display the name of the new component and additional information.

```
<Meta
  title="Example"
  subtitle="This is an example component, which displays text."
/>
```

With the `PropsTable` and `PropsTableRow` the props of the component are explained.

```
<PropsTable>
  <PropsTableRow value="text" required>
    Specify the text which is displayed.
  </PropsTableRow>
</PropsTable>
```

In `PropsTableRow` the user is provided which the information what the prop does, if it is required, whether only certain values are available, if there is a default value, etc.
There should be one row for every prop.
<br />

At the end of the file there must be at least one example provided for the component.
The `ExampleLoader` can be used.
It shows the component and the code for it.
For the Example component the snippet is:

```
<ExampleLoader example="Example.tsx" />
```

<br />
Between the code snippets additional markdown can be added so that the file looks like this:

```
import Meta from "@/components/internal/Documentation/Meta";
import PropsTable from "@/components/internal/Documentation/PropsTable";
import PropsTableRow from "@/components/internal/Documentation/PropsTable/components/PropsTableRow";
import Code from "@/components/internal/Documentation/Code";
import ExampleLoader from "@/documentation/utils/ExampleLoader";

<Meta
  title="Example"
  subtitle="This is an example component, which displays text."
/>

## Property

<PropsTable>
  <PropsTableRow value="text" required>
    Specify the text which is displayed.
  </PropsTableRow>
</PropsTable>

## Example

<ExampleLoader example="Example.tsx" />

```

<br/>

As last step the file must be selectable in the navigation.
For that the `documentation/index.tsx` must be edited.

All components are located under the label `Components`. There a new object must be added with the correct label and path.
In this example this should be added:

```
{
    label: "Example",
    path: "/components/example",
    children: [],
},
```

<span class="text-red-600">Note:</span> If the component name is written in camelCase, everything in the path is written in lower case and there must be a hyphen between the words.

e.g. If the component name is `MyExample` the path should be `my-example`.
